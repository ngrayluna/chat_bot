It shows the top voted answers with their questions. Question votes and answer votes
are also shown. The person who answered and his/her total rep is shown too.

To find out more about the schema:

The StackOverflow database stores question and answers in the same “Posts” table but only questions have view data, 
answers are linked to questions via their parent id (the answer’s parentid will be the question’s id).

In order to get the answer and the question data, we join the “Posts” table to itself
using parentid and id columns: pa.ParentID = pq.ID

We give the two “Post” table instances aliases of pq and pa
