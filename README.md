<h2><a name="about">About</a></h2>  
Chatbot is trained on upvoted answers and their associated parent (original question) from Reddit. The user
interface is developed using Pythonâ€™s Kivy library.

* Workflow completed thus far: downloaded data, pre-processed data, built model, and trained a few models.
* Currently working on training on a larger data set...will need GPU or AWS to do this likely.
* Next steps: limit the vocabulary to allow the LSTM to learn with smaller dataset, finish Kivy GUI, combine
GUI with machine learning model in background.
